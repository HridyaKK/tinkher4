### Project Description

SafePath is a safety mapping web application that analyzes and visualizes location-based safety scores. It helps users identify safer routes and areas using data-driven insights displayed on an interactive map.

### The Problem statement

Many people, especially women and students, lack access to reliable information about the safety of specific areas. There is no easy way to visualize and compare safety levels across locations before traveling.

### The Solution

SafePath provides an interactive map that categorizes areas into Safe, Moderate, and Unsafe zones based on calculated safety scores. The platform offers a simple and intuitive visualization to help users make informed travel decisions.
